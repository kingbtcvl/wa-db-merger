### Context
For the context of this repository see the follwing discussion: https://github.com/ElDavoo/wa-crypt-tools/discussions/118

### Hint
This is **NOT** a project which is being maintained.  
I just uploaded this code because someone asked for it.  
Consequently I won't deal with any issues here.

### Some Notes
This is some code I have programmed when I successfully merged two WhatsApp databases  
and then re-encrypted the result using wa-crypt-tools (https://github.com/ElDavoo/wa-crypt-tools).

**The code is very individual to the problem I had back then and therefore  
(highly likely) can't be used without modificaitions for problems anybody else has.**

**ALWAYS CREATE COPIES OF YOUR DATABASES BEFORE YOU RUN  
THESE   (OR IN FACT ANY) SCRIPTS ON YOUR DATABASES OR  
OTHERWISE IT MIGHT GET DAMAGED IRREPARABLY!**
